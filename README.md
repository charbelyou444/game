This game is a console-based game written in Java that requires the player to add or subtract clones from a group of members. The objective of the game is to avoid reducing the total number of members to zero or exceeding a total of 10 members. The game is played in rounds, and each round the player must choose whether to add or subtract members from the group by selecting the left or right number displayed on the screen.

The game starts with one member, and the player must carefully choose the most suitable number to add to the total number of members to keep it between 1 and 10. The game gets progressively harder.

The player can choose to add or subtract members by selecting the left or right number displayed on the screen. If the player chooses an invalid value or fails to select a number , they will be penalized with a deduction of one round. The player has an extra attempt to get a decent highscore.

The game keeps track of the current number of members, the current round, the high score, and the extra lives remaining. The player has 1 extra life, and if they lose all 2 lives, the game is over.

The game is won if the player reaches 30 rounds without losing all their extra lives. The game is lost if the player loses all their extra lives before reaching 30 rounds. The player can restart the game as many times as they want until they reach their desired score
